Canadian Jurisdictional Health Numbers (JHN) in (at least) some Jurisdictions have version codes that change as new health cards are issued.

**Assumption**, although version codes can be represented as part of the JHN, it is useful to have a stable identifier for a patient that does not change over time.  Therefore, representing the JHN and Version Code separately, will allow the implementers to support two separate requirements concurrently:
1. access to a unique patient identifier within a jurisdiction
2. the means to validate whether a number provided is currently valid

(There are exceptions to above in cases where patients fail to maintain residency or where health cards are used fraudulently. Very likely others.)
