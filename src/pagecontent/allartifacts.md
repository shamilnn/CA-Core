This implementation guide defines a number of FHIR Profiles, ValueSets and CodeSets for Canadian Use and uses others from the base FHIR Specification directly without modification.

Each profile defines the minimum mandatory elements, extensions and terminology requirements that MUST be present. For each profile, requirements and guidance are given in a simple narrative summary. A formal hierarchical table that presents a logical view of the content in both a differential and snapshot view is also provided along with references to appropriate terminologies and examples.
