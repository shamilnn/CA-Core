# CA-Core

### Canadian Core Implementation Guide

This is a [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir) implementation guide that provides basic interoperability expectations for human-patient systems in the Canadian space.  Modeled after the US-Core implementation guide.

#### Status

A **living document** including **draft** profiles initially based on the [USCoreR4 Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/) that are being refined for Canadian use by volunteers participating in the [Canadian FHIR Implementations Working Group - Canadian FHIR Baseline Profiles Workstream](https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/collaboration/wg/fhir-implementations_).

#### Principles

The following principles were applied when creating the profiles:

- *Focus on core content*
- *Be consistent* with other pan-Canadian standards where possible
- *Avoid arbitrary differences* between Canadian and US Core profiles to:
  - increase the opportunity for Digital Health / mHealth application reuse across North America
  - reduce developer / vendor effort to adapt to Canadian requirements
- *Only* impose constraints when strictly necessary
